## The Lab

Our innovation lab is the first step in our R&D process.
- <span className="gold">State-of-the-art AI for business</span> - We study the state-of-the-art AI research straight from AI labs (Graph Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Structural Time Series modeling, Causality) to find ways to apply those techniques on unsolved business problems.  
- <span className="gold">AI For Good</span> - We challenge ourselves to always ensure a responsible use of Data and using our AI algorithms ethically. We research new ways of studying bias, enforcing algorithm transparency or maintaining Data privacy. We also do pro-bono research from climate change to epidemiological modeling. 
- <span className="gold">Data capabilities</span> - in an everchanging field, we need to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies to industrialize, scale, and operate our Data Science solutions. We research and implement connectors to deploy APIs in 5 mins, configure infrastructure-as-code, or facilitate the Data Science workflows with pre-industrialized templates 


## The Factory
Our innovation factory is aimed at developing new solution and prototypes for our clients. We created an inner-source mindset to create, maintain and update canonical blocks which will populate our solutions. 
- <span className="gold">Prism</span> - our internal Marketing Mix Optimization framework powered by Genetic Optimization and Hierarchical Bayesian modeling
- <span className="gold">Horizon</span> - our Demand Forecasting solution with hybrid algorithms to merge business hypotheses and forecasting models (from simple regressions to structural time series models)
- And many more solutions on Customer Centricity, Operational Excellence, or pure Data Science helper tools   


## The Community
Curiosity is one of our key values. We organize several events to keep our Data Scientists updated on the latest trends in the field:
- <span className="gold">Data Science Sessions</span> - weekly presentations on various and sometimes exotic Data topics (Few Shot Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Scaling APIs to Kubernetes clusters, Cellular Automata). 
- <span className="gold">Hack Sessions</span> - bi-monthly collaborative coding sessions to practice and improve our modeling or coding skills
- <span className="gold">Hackathons</span> - twice a year we organize 100+ person hackathons to crack a new business, social or environmental problem with Data Science or just have fun as teams!
